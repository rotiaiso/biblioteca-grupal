This article describes the fundamental applicability of sibling dynamics to a wide range of group experiences and interventions, including the introduc- tion of new members, the special case of only children, twinning between group members, and the cotherapy relationship. We explore patient dreams, the sources of resistance within the profession to the awareness of sibling dynamics, and the therapist’s manage- ment of group boundaries and norms through this lens of sibling dynamics.</p><h1 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: justify;">W<span class="p">hen psychodynamic group therapists interview prospective candi- dates for group therapy, they will most certainly ask questions about the person’s role in his or her family.

Therefore, a member’s interactions with the group therapist are bound to feel significantly like his or her relationship to father, mother, or some- times, both parents. A natural corollary of this supposition is that one’s relationships to one’s fellow group members will mirror in some signifi- cant ways those with one’s sibling(s). At first glance, the parallel between</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 1pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="64" height="0" alt="image" src="shapiro2001_files/Image_001.png"/></span></p><p class="s4" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 117%;text-align: justify;">Elizabeth L.

And yet, even when group therapists focus on sibling dynamics in the initial evaluation, they may rarely anticipate the resurfacing of these dynamics in the group treatment. This omission in the clinical arena parallels the scarcity of rel- evant theoretical writings in the group therapy literature.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Ten years ago Rabin’s (1989) article in this same journal highlighted the neglect of peers and siblings in analytic group psychotherapy. He posited that this neglect results from the analytic stance that horizontal (sibling and peer) transferences are simply derivatives of vertical (paren- tal) transferences. Rabin argued that sibling and peer transferences are important in and of themselves and can significantly enrich the group therapist’s understanding of group dynamics. Since that time, there has been a noticeable dearth of articles directly addressing this connection as its main thesis.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It is the purpose of this article to deepen the understanding of this per- sistent neglect of sibling dynamics in group psychotherapy and to expand the fundamental applicability of sibling dynamics to a wide range of group experiences and interventions. We will begin with a history of the literature on siblings. Next, we will discuss several group treatment events and dynamics that lend themselves to exploration through the lens of internalized sibling relationships. Finally, we will explore some technical considerations in working with sibling phenomena.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Stories of sibling relationships permeate literature from the Bible to the Greek myths. The same is not true when one examines the body of psychotherapeutic literature. The neglect of sibling dynamics is by no means peculiar to the group therapy literature; it is only more surprising. An overwhelming proportion of group therapists are initially trained as individual therapists, and a significant number are trained under the psychodynamic umbrella. Therefore, Freud’s perspective on siblings has probably had a significant impact on many group therapists. Colonna and Newman (1983), in their review article of the psychoanalytic litera- ture on siblings, humorously note that “sibling” does not make it into the index of <span class="s6">The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud</span>, although “Siberia” does. Nonetheless, Freud had more to say on the topic than this would indicate. Although he saw the sibling relation- ship primarily as derivative of the parent/child relationship, he was ada-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">mant about the intensity of the affect surrounding the sibling relationship. Freud is criticized for an almost exclusive focus on the nega- tive impact of the sibling relationship, primarily relating to intense feel- ings of rivalry and envy. For example, he writes of siblings as dangerous objects of incestuous wishes, and their symbolic representation in dreams as “small animals or vermin” (1923/1974, p. 153).</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Because of the overwhelming impact of Freud’s writings on contempo- rary ideas of human development, it is important to stop and note some personal history of Freud’s that no doubt influenced his theories. He was the oldest child of his parents’ marriage. His brother Julius, born just a year after Sigmund, died at the age of seven months. Freud admitted in letters to Fleiss that he had welcomed the death of Julius with “malevo- lent wishes and genuine childhood jealousy” (Gay, 1988, p. 11). After Jul- ius, there were five younger sisters followed by a younger brother. Yet Freud’s closest and sib-like companion was his nephew John-one year older than he and the son of Sigmund’s father’s oldest son from his first marriage. Again in a letter to Fleiss, Freud wrote that Julius and John “now determine what is neurotic, but also what is intense in all my friend- ships” (Gay, 1988, p. 11).</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Freud enjoyed particularly special treatment from his parents. In fact, Gay (1988) wrote that Freud twice commented “that the young man who has been his mother’s unquestioned favorite will develop a sense of tri- umphant self-esteem and, with that, the strength for success in later life” (p. 506). An example of such preferential treatment was the selling of the family piano because his sister’s playing interfered with Sigmund’s stud- ies (Jones, 1953). This preferential treatment followed him to his death. He died not knowing that, 3 years later, four of his five sisters would never make it out of Vienna as he himself had found safe passage to Lon- don. Rosa, Marie, Adolfine, and Pauline all died in Nazi concentration camps.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Freud’s sibling history is thus a rich and complicated one. It is impossi- ble to overlook the implications for his ambivalent perspective on sibling relationships. It appears that, on the one hand, his theoretical writings emphasized the nearly exclusive importance of the parent/child relation- ship, belying his wish to maintain his favored status with his mother as the first-born (which, no doubt suffered at least seven blows with the births of his younger siblings!); and, on the other hand, his more intimate letters to Fleiss acknowleged a more substantive, and not exclusively rivalrous, role of siblings in his own development.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It is Alfred Adler (1927) who is generally regarded as the first major re- searcher in the area of siblings. He delineated the particular advantages and liabilities of being the oldest, middle, and youngest child, and the re- sulting characteristics of each. More recently, Sulloway (1997) wrote about the correlation between birth order and creativity.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Winnicott (1957) wrote about the opportunities siblings provide to play various roles that prepare children for later life, replenishing each other’s resources when dealing with disturbed or physically ill parents, and taking risks that only children may feel too afraid or protected to take.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Klein (1975) claimed that the conflicting impulses and feelings of ag- gression and love in sibling relationships are critical in the development of guilt and wishes to make good (i.e., “reparation”). The establishment of guilt and reparation, in turn, is critical to the development of a healthy social attitude and later relationships.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In contrast to the psychoanalytic literature, the family systems litera- ture has contributed substantially to our knowledge of sibling relation- ships. It acknowledges the existence of the sibling subsystem, but often chooses to focus on a problem within this subsystem as an indication that the parental subsystem is not functioning properly. Most of the relevant family systems literature (e.g., Bowen, 1978; Minuchin, Montalvo, Guerney, Rosman, &amp; Schumer, 1967) consists of case studies of dysfunc- tional families seen by clinicians in local family service agencies.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Instances of the exploration in therapy of the positive impact of sib- lings are beginning to appear in the literature (Bank &amp; Kahn, 1982; Leichtman, 1985; Neubauer, 1983; Provence &amp; Solnit, 1983; Rosner, 1985). It is now more commonly acknowledged that siblings provide such potentially positive influences as intellectual stimulation, opportu- nities for varied roles, enrichment of play experience, models of attach- ment and models for identification, learning a sense of fairness, com- munity and group feeling, and impact on instinctual drive development.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It is also evident that there are a slowly increasing number of refer- ences to such clinical phenomena as sibling transferences in articles and books about disparate subjects; e.g., Ganzarain and Buchele’s (1989) work with sexually abused patients in a group setting. By focusing this ar- ticle directly on sibling dynamics in group therapy, the authors hope to alert other clinicians and researchers to the pervasiveness of these phe- nomena in a wide range of situations.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">SIBLING PHENOMENA IN GROUPS</h2><h2 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Introduction of New Members</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">One way to examine the effects of sibling relationships on group dynam- ics is to consider the introduction of new members into an established group. Leopold (1961) noted that the entrance of a new group member may be conditioned by memories of the arrival of a new sibling in the nu- clear family constellation. We found, however, that the arrival of a new member or members is not evocative solely for older siblings reliving the birth of a younger sibling, but for group members at any place in their family’s birth order.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Case Example #1. <span class="p">Richard joined a group only one month in advance of Jessica. Richard had one twin sister with whom he had a very ambivalent relationship. It was his perception that his twin was always better able to garner their mother’s stingily dispensed attention while he was seen in the family as identified with his remote father. Jessica also had very am- bivalent feelings toward her sister, older by four years. She and her sister suffered from years of harsh comments from their mother comparing the two of them in ways that left both of them simultaneously hopeful and deflated.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In a replay of both members’ early sibling experiences, Richard ini- tially felt that he received less attention in the group than his “twin sister,” Jessica. He became quite despairing, privately thinking about quitting group, until this repeated pattern was identified during one particular group meeting. The group actively encouraged Richard to take his right- ful share of the group’s attention, which he slowly began to do.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Jessica, on the other hand, initially felt the group’s attention to be judg- mental and hostile. She was devastated by her perception that the group found Richard more likable. Then Jessica broke her ankle and was ab- sent for two weeks. She returned to group having promised her husband she would check out her perceptions of the group’s feelings toward her. She began to understand both her projections onto the group, and Rich- ard in particular, but also experienced a deep sadness about not having ever fully experienced her mother’s love.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The therapist wondered, in retrospect, whether he should not have in- troduced these two new members in such quick succession, given the in- tensity of their responses. However, in consultation, the leader came to feel that these two individuals were emotionally equipped to work</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">through the painful process of joining. Although he regretted his failure to anticipate the ensuing dynamics, he believed that the introduction in quick succession may have forced each of them to confront what were some rather stubborn patterns of engagement and disengagement. Con- sultation had the added effect of increasing the therapist’s awareness of both Richard and Jessica’s sibling transferences to each other and to the group, and so he was able to call the group’s attention to these phenom- ena when they arose during group sessions.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Case Example #2. <span class="p">Introducing multiple new members into a group at the same time has risks and benefits. Doing so may compromise the under- standing of individual dynamics (Rutan &amp; Stone, 1993). However, the new member subgroup may enable those who might otherwise be at risk for dropping out to remain in the group. In one instance, a cotherapy team chose to introduce two new members simultaneously.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: right;">The continuing group members referred to Anne and Victoria as the “new members” to differentiate (i.e., scapegoat) them and to not accord them full status. The efforts of continuing members to resist including the new members were explored more easily, as these efforts were experi- enced as less personal by the two new members. It was not until a year af- ter joining, when the group faced incorporating another new member, that the two reflected on their entry into the group. Anne said that she could not have imagined joining alone because it was so difficult. She elaborated that the group members “seemed like friends of her older brothers,” and that she had felt insecure and uncertain of the rules. Anne also expressed her reluctance to give up her position in the group as the newest member. She was used to being the “baby” in her family of origin. The cotherapists based their decision to bring the new members into the group at the same time on Agazarian’s concept of subgrouping. Agazarian (1997) defines <span class="s6">subgrouping </span>as “a conflict resolution technique in which members are deliberately encouraged to form subgroups around two (or more) sides of a conflict. . . Subgroup members work to- gether within their own subgroup to explore similarities (rather than to scapegoat differences)” (p. 307). In this case Anne and Victoria (the new members’ subgroup) worked together successfully on the task of joining.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: right;">The cotherapy team speculated that Anne might easily have left the</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">group without the subgroup experience due to her anxiety.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Sibling dynamics can emerge constructively or traumatically. Con- sidering, anticipating, and illuminating the sibling themes for our pa- tients will strengthen our effectiveness as group therapists. In the first</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">case example, the heightened sibling rivalry, although unanticipated, was dealt with effectively once recognized and acknowledged. In the second example, the new members were able to join the group as “siblings,” but it was not until many months later that individual sibling issues became manifest.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Paradox of Sibling Dynamics and Only Children</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Although only children enter group therapy without some of the compli- cations of sibling transferences, they also lack the early socializing experi- ences that sibling relationships provide.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Case Example #3. <span class="p">Laurie, an only child, had been in individual and group therapy for 2 years. The group was led by two cotherapists. When the therapists announced that two new members were joining the group, Laurie was the only member who expressed positive feelings. As the day of the new members’ arrival neared, Laurie remained focused on her therapy goals, which included managing feelings, achieving intimacy, and coping with depression. While empathic toward other members who were angry and anxious about the shifting boundaries and increased numbers, she was notably less distressed and distracted. At this time, Laurie became engaged to be married. She spoke of the group as “fam- ily” and expressed the wish for the entire group to attend her wedding.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Over many months, Laurie explored her fantasies and recognized how the group was fulfilling her wish for siblings and perceived the impossibil- ity of bringing her wish into reality. As the day of her wedding ap- proached and family conflicts surfaced, Laurie tended to idealize group members who offered support and encouragement.  In fact, Laurie stated that when she received feedback from the group prior to her wed- ding day, it was “one of the warmest and most meaningful experiences of my life.” Subsequently, she told the group of leaving the session and working to hold onto the feelings of closeness elicited by the care and concern she had experienced. Soon after the wedding and honeymoon, Laurie experienced a feeling of loss related to no longer being the center of attention in the group. She experienced heightened anger and frustra- tion in her group interactions for the first time, which enabled her to de- velop greater depth and authenticity in her relationships.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The process of working through these issues clarified many central themes for this patient, notably, her wish for siblings to share and validate her experiences, and her discomfort with rivalry and competition in rela-</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">tionships. Laurie, who had grown up in a single parent home, was able to express in group how the lack of sibling relationships was a distinct disad- vantage personally and professionally. Her ability to express her feelings indicated increasing capacity for closeness as well as for integrating posi- tive and negative feelings. Conflicts related to rivalry and competition are universal. Group members who are only children have less experi- ence grappling with these conflicts in family relationships. Only children may experience heightened discomfort, and, as in the case of Laurie, shame associated with these feelings. Group treatment offers these pa- tients the opportunity to work on relationships with other group mem- bers functioning as siblings.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Twinning</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Twinning is a concept used by Kohut (1971) and others to describe a phe- nomenon wherein representations of oneself are projected into another and provoke an intense bond that stimulates a sense of wholeness in the presence of the other. Biological twinship is neither necessary nor suffi- cient for this twinning process to occur, although close proximity, as oc- curs with most siblings, can engender this phenomenon. The following case example illustrates twinning between two group members.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: right;">Case Example #4. <span class="p">Tess and Liza were both original members of the same group. Tess was rather outgoing and Liza was more reserved. The two de- veloped a powerful bond that excluded other members of the group. When another member of the group was talking, Tess and Liza often made eye contact with each other to communicate their often shared reactions to the material. Group members expressed their annoyance to no avail. Neither woman missed a session for the first several months of the group. It was not until the second year of the group that Liza faced the most anxiety-laden experience of her group tenure when Tess was absent for three weeks due to an injured back. It was only then that Liza-and, subsequently, Tess-began to confront the meaning of this relationship to her group “twin.” Liza described her siblings, all brothers, as alternately sadistic and withdrawn. She had often longed for a sister while growing up, reassured by a fantasy of spending long leisurely hours talking inti- mately with her sister. Liza eagerly attached to Tess from the onset, par- ticularly when the group experienced its first session filled with inter- group conflict. Tess was the good sibling Liza had only experienced in her fantasies, and provided Liza with a long-awaited loving, compassion-</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">ate, and empathic “twin.” Tess was the oldest in her family with a younger retarded brother whom she both loved for his gentleness and hated for his drain on her parents’ limited energy.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The twinning between Tess and Liza provided them with safety and re- duced vulnerability at the group’s inception, and in this sense was a posi- tive experience for them. However, each had a part of the self engaged within this twinship bubble, leaving little psychic energy for authentic re- lationships with the other group members. Over time, the therapist care- fully observed and commented on the nonverbal communication be- tween Tess and Liza. She encouraged the exploration of both their individual responses to the group process, thereby promoting individua- tion, and their defensive need to exclude the group. It took several years before both relinquished this twinning relationship.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Sibling Dynamics in the Cotherapy Relationship</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">While the cotherapy relationship has been compared to a marriage (Heilfron, 1969), the presence of sibling dynamics in the cotherapy rela- tionship deserves consideration (Roller &amp; Nelson, 1991). As Kahn and Lewis (1988) note, “healthy sibling and professional relationships involve a balance between autonomy and belonging, between complementary behaviors and symmetrical behaviors” (p. 408).</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Therapists are influenced by their own family dynamics and birth or- der, and nowhere is this more likely to be stimulated than in the intense and, at times, regressive group therapy experience. There are several as- pects of the cotherapy situation that evoke the sibling experience. Cotherapists are frequently unequal in training and experience. Apman and Roller (1995) address the potential problems for the cotherapy team when a senior clinician and a novice group therapist work together. They suggest that this imbalance of power may hinder communication and the team’s ability to handle complex clinical material. The difference in se- niority can simulate sibling birth order and its attendant affects.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The division of housekeeping tasks (e.g., billing and accounting, phone calling, and marketing) may lead to resentment. The distribution of “goodies” between the therapists also may be a source of conflict. “Goodies” most obviously refers to financial remuneration, but also in- cludes positive regard and feedback from group members.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Effective cotherapy requires a significant commitment to the relation- ship so that both therapists can communicate and contain feelings in the</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">group, which may, at various times, be pleasant, aggressive, ambivalent, or even destructive. It is common for group members to vacillate between re- sponding to a cotherapy team as an authority or parental unit and as a split team, in which one or the other therapist may contain negative attributes of the group members. When group members project negative affect onto one therapist, it is only through careful and deliberate processing of the ex- perience that the feeling can be contained and worked through. If either therapist responds to the group experience with a loss of perspective by taking things personally, an opportunity is lost for the group.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Case Example #5. <span class="p">As a psychology intern in a community mental health center, Paul had the opportunity to co-lead an outpatient group with his supervisor, Chris. Initially, the clearly defined supervisory relationship en- abled Paul to function in his familiar role of youngest sibling. It stimulated feelings of being special, well-liked, and respected professionally. The su- pervisor was highly committed to Paul’s training and the role was consis- tent, in part, with his role as eldest of three children. In fact, for Paul, the supervisor became an idealized older brother. The supervisor was kind, supportive, and available to discuss the group. However, a series of events, including Paul’s completion of his doctorate, caused an impasse in the re- lationship that interfered with communication and trust. The difficulty ne- gotiating the changed circumstances led to the ending of the group.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The training relationship is important but transitory. Paul’s progres- sion in status from psychology intern to licensed psychologist necessi- tated a redefinition of the therapists’ relationship from a supervisory one to a collegial one. The therapists had difficulty with this task in much the same way that some siblings have difficulty redefining roles and relation- ships as they move from childhood to adulthood. Because this change was not talked about, tension increased. It is important for sibling dy- namics to be acknowledged and discussed openly in the cotherapy rela- tionship, otherwise the viability of the group may be jeoparized.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN WORKING WITH SIBLING DYNAMICS</h2><h2 style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Therapists’ Resistance to the Awareness of Sibling Dynamics</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">As stated earlier in this article, group therapists’ own therapies are unlikely to have focused on the analysis of their sibling relationships. From an in- formal poll of colleagues, we found that the few who did spend much time</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">talking about their sibling relationships did not remember their therapists making interpretations or any significant interventions on the topic. In part because of this absence of attention to our own sibling relationships, we are unlikely to recognize these transferences when they arise with ei- ther our individual or group patients and we may fail to adequately value them. To some extent, this will probably continue to be a blind spot in the profession until a critical mass of therapists has their own sibling transferences analyzed in individual or-even better-in training or psycho- therapy groups. Until that time, we unfortunately remain vulnerable to a myriad of unanalyzed conscious and unconscious reactions to our pa- tients’ material that can ultimately subvert the therapeutic process.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">This collective blind spot may point to the power of the sibling experi- ence. As we recognize, attend to, and comment upon sibling dynamics in our group patients, we must spend time experiencing some of these same dynamics in ourselves. A heightened awareness of sibling experiences can be quite painful. We may recall (a) the guilt for having left behind an emotionally incapacitated sibling, (b) the idealization (obscuring some hate) of an older sibling, (c) unconscious or conscious anger at a more in- tellectually endowed sibling, (d) a persistent sense of emptiness without the geographical proximity of a sibling, or (e) the fear that enjoyment of one’s own success will be damaging to a sibling. Attention to these blind spots may well encourage group therapists to embrace this additional perspective on group dynamics.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Patient Dreams</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Group members’ dreams, particularly ones that feature other group members in starring roles, are often opportunities for the members to work through sibling transferences.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Case Example #6. <span class="p">Natalie was a 39-year-old woman who had been in the group for 3 years when she presented the following dream: “I was on a date with a man and sitting in my mother’s house with him. In walk Leslie and Ethan [two members who had entered the group together approxi- mately eight months earlier]. Then I realized that my mother has sold the house to Leslie and Ethan. I was devastated by this realization, particu- larly when I found out that my mother made no effort to save my belong- ings-the ones that were emotionally really significant to me.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">Unbeknownst to the group, Leslie and Ethan’s entry into the group was devastating for Natalie who felt robbed of the fantasied opportunity</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">to take more of her rightful space in the group. Kaplan and Roman (1961) believe that the introduction of a new member is experienced to some degree by all members as a narcissistic trauma, as evidenced in their increased concern about status and recognition. Additionally, Natalie felt intensely critical of the therapist for failing to see her need. It would have been all too easy to focus exclusively on Natalie’s transferential ex- perience of maternal neglect. Fortunately, I (E.S.) was beginning work on this article and was hyperalert to my group members’ sibling relation- ships. The impact of two members entering the group simultaneously ex- erted a greater impact on Natalie than on some other members because of the uncomfortable parallel to her relationship to two older siblings who were paired together. In Natalie’s estimation, these siblings re- ceived the lion’s share of the parental attention, while Natalie and her younger sister were paired together as the two less deserving siblings in the family. The dream gave Natalie, who often behaved in group like the proverbial wallflower at the dance, an opportunity to expose her secret anger and longings. Analysis of her dream by the group revealed her de- sire for more attention, her hope that somehow she could attain it through passivity, her resentment of the two new members, and her an- ger at the group leader for introducing two new members to the group at an inauspicious time for her.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Therapist’s Management of Group Boundaries and Norms</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">It is presumably every group therapist’s intention to treat all group mem- bers equally. Such parameters as the group contract-which all members must agree to-are designed to insure both a feeling of safety and an expec- tation of equal treatment by the group leader. And yet, despite our best intentions, there are particular group members at particular moments in the history of each group who call forth an unequal response. This re- sponse is sometimes experienced internally and sometimes externally in a manner that is obvious to all the group members.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: justify;">Case Example #7. <span class="p">Max was the only man in a supposedly mixed gender group. His unique status as the only man mirrored his repeated desire to be treated specially. This desire erupted in a particularly potent fashion when he announced to the group that he had the opportunity to take a 6-week leave of absence from his job to work with some friends on the west coast on a start-up internet company. Max would not be paid by his employer during this hiatus. In a non-negotiable fashion, he announced</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">that he wanted to take a leave from the group and did not expect to pay while he was gone. (He informed the group that he would not return to the group unless he got his way.) This request was debated by the group for the 2 weeks before Max was to leave.</p><p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The group leader, reluctant to let the only man in the group go, mistak- enly allowed the group to decide. Although the group openly voiced am- bivalence about the special treatment this plan entailed, they neverthe- less allowed him to take a leave without pay. The leader immediately regretted her failure to intervene and hold Max to the same commitment as the others.</p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">In this case, the leader sought consultation with a colleague and was re- minded of a dynamic in her own family wherein her brother was granted greater latitude by their mother than she and her sister. Gaining this per- spective could not undo the favoritism she had unconsciously exhibited because Max never returned to group after his “unpaid leave.” Nonethe- less, the self-knowledge at least encouraged her to admit her own mistake to the group and accept without defensiveness the group’s anger at her.</p><h2 style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">SUMMARY</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 63pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 111%;text-align: justify;">The group therapy literature, and the analytic literature in general, tends to focus primarily and sometimes exclusively on the parent/child rela- tionship, to the exclusion of the sibling relationship. Hence, it requires a kind of paradigm shift for the group therapist to turn his or her attention to the importance of the sibling relationship. A more thorough knowl- edge of the sibling literature than is usually required of the trained group therapist, as well as careful attention to the sibling dynamics operating in groups, can give group therapists the ability to appreciate dynamics hith- erto inadequately understood. It is our recommendation that courses and workshops, supervision and training groups, as well as the therapist’s own group therapy be used as tools to understand both sibling transferences and countertransferences that continually arise in the course of the group therapist’s professional life.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 68pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">REFERENCES</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: justify;">Adler, A.
