Sibling attitudes have been explored in the context of the parent-child relationship, but traditional focusing on the &quot;mothering one&quot; or the father tends to obscure the often pow­ erful impact of relatively independent sibling interactions. Broth­ ers and sisters usually spend at least as much time together as each spends with the parents, but the significance of their reciprocal in­ fluences tends to be overlooked. Indeed, inattention to feelings and attitudes rooted in sibling relationships can be a source of therapeutic stalemate, if not failure.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">In her reanalysis of 37 patients, Szalita (1968) reported that &quot;omission of an important early relationship, usually with a sib­ ling,&quot; was one reason for dissatisfaction with previous analyses. My own work with patients in second and third analyses reinforces Szalita&#39;s finding that sibling relationships often go unexplored. Supervision of candidates in psychoanalytic training also highlights the consequences of inadequate attention to sibling influences in the candidate&#39;s personal analysis. Since personal analysis is prob­ ably the most important aspect of training for analytic work, in­ attention to sibling influence tends to be perpetuated.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">My purpose here is to direct attention to the therapeutic import of investigating sibling interactions, particularly as they are reac­ tivated in the transference. Traditional biases, countertransferen­ tial tendencies, and other factors that have obscured the signifi­ cance of sibling transference are discussed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s2" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">Journal of the American Academy of Psychoanalysis, Vol. 6, No. 1, 37-49 (1978)</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">e <span class="s2">1978 John Wiley &amp; Sons, lnc.           0090-3604/78/0006-0037$01.00</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">STUDIES OF <b>SIBLING </b>INFLUENCE</p><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Over the years, experimental psychologists have studied the in­ fluence that siblings exert on each other. It is unfortunate that their findings have not been assimilated into the psychotherapist&#39;s repertoire because they shed light on specific sibling interactions that often become grist for analysis. Sutton-Smith and Rosenberg provided a comprehensive survey of research studies in <span class="s4">The Sibling </span>(1970), calling attention to the inherent difficulties of separating the &quot;silent variable&quot; of sibling interaction from the powerful parent-child relationship. They demonstrated that number of chil­ dren in the family, age-spacing, and sex have an independent effect upon personality, influencing a child &#39;s interests, preferences, abil­ ities, and behavior.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h4 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">FAMILY AND GROUP PSYCHOTHERAPY</h4><p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">Early literature on family therapy paid scant attention to sibling interactions, focusing mainly on each child&#39;s role vis-a-vis the par­ ent. Recently, however, sorne family therapists have focused more directly on sibling interactions. Bank and Kahn (1975) emphasized the influence of sibling interactions in terms of identification, dif­ ferentiation, and ego regulation. They pointed out the importance of &quot;sibling subsystems,&quot; in which siblings render services to each other (by forming friendships or providing information, for exam­ ple) and may join forces to deal with parental power. Sibling influ­ ences still constitute a relatively unexplored area in the field of family therapy. Bank and Kahn noted that,they unearthed their findings from only several &quot;scattered islands of research and theory&quot; (p. 313).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">References to sibling transference can be encountered in analy­ tic group-therapy literature, as would be expected in a procedure that affords a multiplicity of transference possibilities. The major­ ity of authors, however, convey the impression that attitudes and feelings rooted in sibling relationships are transferred to other patients-peers who  function  as substitute siblings-while the group therapist is related to as a parental figure.</p><h4 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">THEORETICAL BIAS</h4><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">The potential for sibling transference was briefly alluded to by Freud in his essay on transference (1921). Rather than being bound to parental prototypes, he stated, transference may proceed from the &quot;brother imago&quot; (p. l00). Other brief references to sib­ ling transference are scattered through the literature, but no one has written comprehensively on siblings as personae in the trans­ ference drama.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">Theoretical bias may be paramount among the various factors that have obscured recognition of sibling influence in personality development. Certainly the Freudian concept of transference en­ courages the view that the patient, in the transference state, relives &quot;his infantile Oedipal neurosis ...  the core problem of human existence&quot; (Singer, 1965, p. 253). Furthermore, the classical psy­ choanalytic situation fosters a striking contrast in the role of the analyst as the parent-authority figure resembling &quot;the omnipotent parents of early childhood&quot; and the &quot;childlike role of the analys­ and&quot; in the supine position (Stone, 1961).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Adler (1931) associated specific personality characteristics with each ordinal position but was parent-centered in his discussions of siblings. Sullivan, while recognizing ali sorts of interpersonal influ­ ences outside the home, neglected the role of siblings. He inquired about the number of siblings but obtained this information be­ cause it &quot;might have been of particular significance to (the pa­ tient&#39;s) parents and thus have a considerable effect on (the pa­ tient)&quot; (1953, p. 73). Here again the emphasis is on parental attitudes. The only sibling interaction pattem Sullivan regarded as significant was the influence of an older sister who might have served as a mother surrogate. Sullivan stressed the important role of playmates and chums in the developmental process; but because of his focus on the parent-child relationship, he failed to associate the ability to establish chumships with previous experiences with siblings.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">In short psychoanalytic theory, abetted by the conventions of practice, creates a set in the patient and in the therapist that nurtures virtually exclusive emphasis on the child-parent relation­ ship. Llttle room is left for awareness of the recapitulation in the transference of relationships to one&#39;s siblings.</p><h3 style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS</h3><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">In discussing the case of Frau P., Freud (1896) reported that her symptoms appeared when her brother, following a quarrel with her husband, stopped visiting her. Freud attributed Frau P.&#39;s paranoia to the return of repressed memories of sexual episodes with her brother in childhood. Further information in the report, however, encourages another speculation. It appears to me that Frau P.&#39;s early relationship with her brother may have been sup­ portive, and its loss might have precipitated the breakdown. Freud stated that Frau P. had always been &#39;&#39;very fond&quot; of her brother &quot;and missed him very much at this time&quot; (p. 179).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">In a case cited by Fromm-Reichmann (1950), access to the cen­ tral dynamics of the patient&#39;s difficulties was totally blocked by the therapist&#39;s failure to elicit the fact that the patient had a brother. Eventually it became clear that the relationship with this brother, &quot;which was perpetuated outside awareness and therefore never reevaluated, was the primary root of the patient&#39;s anxiety&quot; (p. 149). Thus the potential significance of the sibling relationship and its consequences for other interpersonal relationships, includ­ ing that with the therapist, was not recognized &quot;for a long time.&#39;&#39; The time-consuming stalemate in this case might have been avoided if the therapist&#39;s preconceptions of what was primarily important in a person&#39;s development-relationships with parents-had not limited the inquiry. Not only had the patient &quot;forgotten&quot; to men­ tion his brother, but the therapist had also &quot;forgotten&quot; to inquire into the existence of siblings.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">Guntrip (1975) gave an account of his prolonged quest for the</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 92%;text-align: justify;">&quot;real core&quot; of severely incapacitating illnesses which, throughout the course of his life, followed the deaths of friends and col­ leagues. His two analyses failed to resolve the problem. I believe that the meaning of Guntrip&#39;s sibling loss in early childhood was not explored sufficiently by either of his analysts. It was only at age 70, sorne years after the termination of the second analysis, that Guntrip, through two dreams, was able to break through bis amnesia for the circumstances surrounding his brother&#39;s death. His illnesses following the loss of friends appear to have been transfer­ ential in origin, each loss triggering a recrudescence of the shatter­ ing impact of bis brother&#39;s death, which had exercised &quot;an uncon­ scious pull out of life into collapse and apparent dying&quot; (p. 150).</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">Analysis had helped Guntrip recognize that, on losing his broth­ er, he had been left with a mother who would not keep him alive;</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">but Guntrip&#39;s description of his early schizoid isolation with a mother who failed &quot;to relate at all right from the start&quot; (p. 147) suggests to me that the brother was the source of the only vital relationship Guntrip experienced in his early years. I believe that this younger sibling may have provided a deeply needed living presence and mitigated feelings of loneliness generated by the mother&#39;s total rejection. In that context, the exceptionally severe reaction to the loss of friends and colleagues becomes compre­ hensible.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">A case reported by Meyendorf (1971) lends support to the above hypothesis. A patient, age 19 months, developed an acute depression with neurological symptoms upon being separated from her mother and two older siblings. The life-threatening deteriora­ tion continued even though the mother returned. It was only after the patient was reunited with her siblings that the first signs of improvement appeared.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">CLINICAL ILLUSTRATIONS</h3><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 93%;text-align: justify;">In my own practice I have seen how easy it is to overlook the phenomenon of sibling transference.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">In retrospect, I attribute the precipitous withdrawal from treat­ ment of two of my patients to my failure to &lt;leal sufficiently with the sibling transference. Initially these patients, one female and the other male, had responded favorably to analysis. Both were &quot;middle&quot; children with an enormous need for the affection and approval of a more mature sibling in order to feel sorne sense of uniqueness in their respective large families.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">Each of these patients recalled hurtful interactions with an old­ er sister, whose friendly promises had been experienced as a form of psychological seduction. Although other important sibling in­ teractions were explored, the impact of this particular pattem of relatedness was not fully appreciated when it was re-experienced in the analytic process. Transference expressions suggested that both patients related to me as the kindly but overworked mother or as the affectionate but ineffectual father. I did not recognize that they also related to me at times as the clever but disappoint­ ing sister until they had withdrawn from treatment-as suddenly and with as much finality as each had withdrawn from a sibling relationship fraught with disappointment and humiliation.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The case of a 40-year-old woman, Miss <span class="h3">M., </span>illustrates the infinite</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">complexity of sibling interactions. When Miss M. carne to me for reanalysis, she complained of her inability to gain satisfaction in any intimate contact with a man. Initially we focused upon her relationship with her parents and an older sister who had served as a mother-surrogate; the role of an older brother was not sys­ tematically explored. In contrast to her father, the brother exerted a positive influence on the patient; he was concerned about her welfare and encouraged interest in activities that eventually be­ carne important sources of gratification for her. However, it was difficult for Miss M. to sustain a relationship with a man; at most, she achieved only brief satisfaction.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">Eventually it became clear that her experience with her brother, a relatively transient presence in her life, had inculcated the feeling that a long-term heterosexual relationship was not possible; she feared she would be abandoned after a short time. These fears of abandonment were particularly intense with persons whom she regarded as constructive influences in her life, including her two previous male analysts. Her analytic hours with them were often productive, she reported, but there appeared to have been little carryover from one session to the next. The significance of her relationship with her brother had been overlooked in the earlier analyses, which had centered on her parents or on the mother­ surrogate, her sister. Neither analysis pointed to the similarity in her relationship to the analyst and to her brother. With regard to both the analyst and her brother, out of sight literally meant out of mind for Miss M. She remained essentially detached and hostile in heterosexual relationships until the sibling roots of these atti­ tudes were established. The work on sibling transference finally enabled her to commit herself to a man whom she eventually married.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Mr. T., a 24-year-old depressed and rather schizoid man enter­ ing reanalysis, was attracted only to inaccessible women. His per­ sistent, often bizarre attentiveness inevitably met with rejection, but he nursed the fantasy that his devotion would eventually be rewarded.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">During the early part of the analysis, Mr. T. related to me in a &quot;reasonable&quot; but robot-like way, He easily &quot;understood&quot; many of my questions and comments, but our work did not seem to have any real impact. Early efforts, to explore his relationship with a slightly older sister were fruitless; repeatedly he disclaimed any interest in what she thought or felt about him. <span class="s5">It </span>was after Mr. T. reported the following dream that the roots of his attraction to rejecting women became apparent.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I was in a car conversing with my sister, not too loudly because l didn&#39;t want my father to hear. My sister told me she had hated me for quite a while. 1 corrected her and told her she hated me from the very be­ ginning. She reflected on that and agreed.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">His associations to the dream included a memory of his sister&#39;s refusing to take a walk with sorne friends if he joined them. The patient stated that this was childish and ridiculous behavior on her part, but that he &quot;understood&quot; a sister not wanting her kid broth­ er around. He also &quot;understood&quot; why girl friends could not accept his devotion. They, like his sister, were immature and insecure and could not tolerate positive feelings.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">I suggested to Mr. T. that he did not want to &quot;hear&quot; how deeply he had been hurt by his sister. He then reported that these women strikingly resembled his sister, physically as well as psychological­ ly. He then became aware that seeking these relationships, al­ though inevitably disappointing, was preferable to re-experiencing his sister&#39;s deep hatred.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">Beneath Mr. T.&#39;s &quot;understanding&quot; of me was a deep fear that in­ evitably he would encounter complete rejection, just as he had with his sister. His detachment and isolation served to protect him from the destructive hostility he anticipated in any close relation­ ship.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">Mrs. L. entered analysis complaining of severe and paralyzing anxiety, which had prevented her from seeking medica} advice about her younger daughter&#39;s abnormally small size; she felt cer­ tain the physician would confirm her fears that the child was a dwarf.</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">Mrs. L. described the &quot;charms&quot; of this younger of her two daughters. Acknowledging that she had somewhat &quot;spoiled&quot; the child, she stated that she admired the child&#39;s &quot;spunk&quot; and ability to get what she wanted. My impression, however, was that the youngster was tyrannizing the whole family with her irrational and repeated demands for immediate satisfaction. As Mrs. L. recalled early experiences with another despot, her sickly younger sister, it became apparent that the reign of terror to which Mrs. L.&#39;s pre­ sent family was subjected resembled the situation in Mrs. L.&#39;s childhood home. She had always felt sorry for her younger sister, whose ill health and unhappy, unfulfilled life evoked feelings of guilt in Mrs. L. At the expense of her own spontaneity, she had emulated her mother and devoted herself to appeasing and making life easier for her younger sister.</p><p style="padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">With me, Mrs. L. was overly considerate. She often hesitated</p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">to make a routine request, such as changing an appointment, ap­ parently assuming that I would regard it as an imposition. When I referred her to an appropriate specialist for her child, she became anxious and feared that my meeting her needs would be too much for me. Mrs. L. was repeating with me the early pattem of her rela­ tionship with her sister, and her two daughters were relating to each other similarly. Thus, like Mrs. L., the older daughter was making sacrifices and becoming an overly serious and guilt-ridden youngster, while the younger daughter thrived in her tyranny.</p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h2 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">COUNTERTRANSFERENCEISSUES</h2><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">Traditionally, the analyst-the &quot;doctor&quot;-is considered, and usu­ ally considers himself, to be an authority-expert. His task is to diagnose and treat those who solicit his services-persons who are defined by themselves and others as &quot;sick.&quot; Dr. Robert Holt (per­ sonal communication) suggests that the &quot;authority&quot; role may secretly gratify omnipotent wishes in the analyst. Menninger re­ marked that &quot;sorne physicians almost consciously play the role of the &#39;grand&#39; father ... rare indeed the doctor who perceives that he is unintentionally filling the role of a sister, a mother, ora hated employer&quot; (1961, p. 78). Tenacious adherence to the authority figure role may represent a defensive maneuver on the analyst&#39;s part, one that protects him from his own feelings of inadequacy. Furthermore, the analyst who equates the completion of many years of training with being an expert may be loath to acknowl­ edge that the patient may relate to him as &quot;one of the kids.&quot;</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">The following anecdotes illustrate the compelling nature of sibling influence and- its significance for analytic work.</p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 13pt;line-height: 87%;text-align: justify;">In a postdoctoral seminar I conducted a few years ago, candi­ dates were asked to identify the salient issues in a case that had just been presented. lmpressed with how differently they r.eacted to the material, I suggested that we investigate the extent to which each reaction might have reflected the speaker&#39;s birth order (un­ known at the time). After we classified the comments in terms of this. variable, it became clear that candidates who focused primar­ ily on vicissitudes in the patient&#39;s current relations with an author­ ity figure were only children; those who stressed the patient&#39;s manipulative attitudes were first-born children; candidates who were most concerned about the emotional deprivation that the patient had experienced were youngest children.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 13pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">In supervisory sessions with candidates who had undergone at least four years of analysis or had already completed it, several supervisees expressed surprise that interventions they had thought would be supportive were experienced by their patients as ex­ tremely critical. These reactions were puzzling because the candi­ date had not been aware of feeling judgmental or angry at the time. With discussion it became clear that each candidate had dis­ sociated his/her intensely hostile feelings toward younger siblings, and that the subject of their sibling relationships had hardly been touched upon in their personal analyses.</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">One supervisee recalled that she had been unable to accept hav­ ing hostile feelings toward her younger sister. &quot;1 was the strong, wise, and controlled one,&quot; she said, &quot;and I did not allow myself to  feel anything as petty as annoyance.&quot; In supervision, she eventually became aware that she tended to &quot;prevent&quot; herself from reacting fully to her patient &quot;just as I restrict the range of reactions I feel with my sister.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">Another candidate described a session in which her patient talked vaguely about his attempts to find work. The therapist volunteered numerous suggestions for him to follow in his pursuit of a job. When I asked her what had prompted these &quot;helpful&quot; suggestions, it became clear that she had been masking anger and frustration at the time. Further exploration showed that she had been relating to the patient as she did to her younger brother, whom she described as lazy, spoiled, and self-indulgent. &quot;He never finishes anything,&quot; she said, &quot;and doesn&#39;t know what to do.&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">In reporting on the case of a schizoid man, another candidate expressed contempt and derision for the patient&#39;s often inappropri­ ate and naive behavior. These attitudes were congruent with those evoked in the therapist by his much younger brother, an unsophis­ ticated youth. The therapist felt superior to this sibling-charac­ terized as a &quot;toy&quot; and &quot;someone to tease&quot;-and also somewhat abuse_d when the boy defied his orders. When the supervisee final­ ly recognized his sibling countertransferential attitudes toward the patient, they no longer served as an interference in the treatment relationship.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><h3 style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS</h3><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 13pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">In exploring a patient&#39;s interactions with a sibling who has served as a parent substitute, analysts tend to equate the sibling&#39;s</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">influence with that of the parent. Failure to take cognizance of the &quot;specific influence, a different qualitative force which siblings may exert&quot; (Ekstein, 1963, p. 509) may lead to inaccurate analy­ sis. These special effects were observed by Rosenbaum (1963) in reporting on a child raised by an older sister. Sibling rejection or deprivation may have a more traumatic impact on a child than similar experiences in relation to a parent, Rosenbaum postulated, because sibling hatred gives rise to the &quot;most destructive fantasies and impulses human beings possess&quot; (p. 517). Moreover, the im­ maturity of the sibling precludes the operation of inner controls and the tempering force of maternal drives.</p><p style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">In shattering the myth that a child always loves his sisters and</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">brother, Freud (1900) stated:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 18pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Children are completely egoistic; they feel their needs intensely and strive ruthlessly to satisfy them-especially as against the rivals, other children, and first and foremost as against their brothers and sisters <span class="s2">(p. </span>250).</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s7" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">A <span class="s8">byproduct of this discovery has been the often dispropor­ tionate emphasis given to competitive strivings among siblings, while their positive interactions tend to be overlooked. lndeed, affectionate attitudes have traditionally been viewed as a cover for the more basic &quot;rivalry for parental love, for common possessions, for living space&quot; [Freud, 1915-1917, p. 205).</span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: left;">When positive sibling attachments are not explored, an impor­ tant resource in the patient&#39;s development that might be tapped remains dormant. Searles (1961) elucidated the significance of affectionate identification with a younger sibling for a schizophre­ nic woman. The patient&#39;s anxiety diminished and her relations with others, including the analyst, became friendlier after she was moved from one hospital room to another. She asked whether the new room was &quot;supposed to be my sister Lucille.&quot; Searles postu­ lated that &quot;this move had symbolized a shift from her identifying until now with her loyally-clung-to but considerably ego-frag­ mented mother, to her identifying now with this sister, who in reality was a much better integrated person than the mother ... playing an increasingly valuable part in the patient&#39;s recovery (pp. 363-364).&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 12pt;line-height: 91%;text-align: justify;">It must be recognized, of course, that what may look like dis­ torted attitudes and feelings towards either parents or siblings may not be entirely transferential but may reflect the real identity</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">...</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">...</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">of the analyst. Sornetirnes the analyst rnay behave as a sibling. This phenornenon is rnost frequently seen when both participants becorne a subsystem and join together to fight the parent. Thus the notion that one functions rnerely as a parental symbol for the patient  forecloses the understanding and working through of intrapsychic conflicts related to siblings, as well as others, and may actually screen the real interaction between the therapist and the patient.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">When a youthful analyst insists that a patient twice his age con­ sistently transfers to hirn attitudes and feelings that were previous­ ly experienced  with parental figures, careful scrutiny of the evidence is in order, however deeply one respects the power of transference. It rnay becorne clear that the therapist has been rnak­ ing defensive use of the concept of transference to shelter hirnself frorn his own insecurity and frorn the true irnpact of the patient&#39;s personali ty.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">In cases of neurosis, as has been noted, sibling transference is subtly expressed and often closely interwoven with manifestations of attitudes toward parent-authority figures. It is a &quot;silent vari­ able.&quot; The reactivation of sibling relationships in cases of psycho­ sis is more vivid. According to Searles <span class="s12">(l </span>964) the neurotic exper­ iences the therapist as being <i>like </i>or <i>reminding </i>the patient of an irnportant figure in his life, whereas the psychotic experiences the therapist as actually <i>being </i>that person. Fromm-Reichmann <span class="s13">(l </span>959) was told by one recovering schizophrenic woman, &quot;You were my rnother, and I hated you for that. My sister ...  did not once come to see me, although she had prornised to. So you becarne sister, and I hated you for that&quot; (p. 122). Communications of this nature rnake it virtually irnpossible to ignore the phenornenon of sibling transference.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">Wolstein, in extending Sullivan&#39;s conception of the therapeutic transaction, identified the analyst as <i>coparticipant </i>in &quot;the shared, two-way ...  structure of psychoanalytic inquiry&quot; (1977, p. 29). This idea establishes a field in which the therapist rnay experience himself as a peer with the patient, and thus facilitates the scrutiny of the patient&#39;s sibling relationships. With growing acceptance of the view that analysis is a collaborative venture, it is likely that sensitivity to sibling transference will be enhanced.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 12pt;text-align: justify;">The evidence I have presented suggests that systematic scrutiny of our patients&#39; relationships with siblings as well as with parent­ authority figures would be therapeutically rewarding and would broaden our understanding of the factors that influence personal-</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 90%;text-align: justify;">ity development. Explorations of sibling transference deepen our understanding of the patient&#39;s characteristic modes of relating to others. The analyst who would work productively in the &quot;living theater&quot; (Levenson, 1971) of therapy cannot limit himself to any one role. She/he must allow her/himself to be transformed into a sibling as well as a parent. Sometimes she/he may be both simul­ taneously.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s14" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">References</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 30pt;text-indent: -24pt;text-align: justify;">Adler, A. <span class="s16">(1931), </span><i>What Life Should Mean to You, </i>Grosset and Dunlap, New York.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: -23pt;text-align: justify;">Bank, S and Kahn, M. <span class="s16">(1975), </span>Sisterhood-brotherhood is powerful.
